# Project D
This is a demo project for this capstone course. The project is to create an app that shares baby pictures with other family members. (This is a fake repository, which does not have actual code here.)

## The prototype description
- the prototype should have a landing page, which has:
  - the website name ("Baby Pictures"), 
  - a sign in form for the user to log in, and
  - a sign up link to go to the sign up page.
- after the user logs in, home page will be opened and show the basic information about the user
  - list the babies that the user has followed
  - a link to the user profile page
- the user profile page should have a form for the user to update, which includes:
  - the user name
  - the profile picture
